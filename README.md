## Installation
Get the [latest pack](https://github.com/OmegaZeron/Oracle-of-Seasons-AP-Poptracker-Pack/releases/latest) from the releases page. Then drag and drop the .zip file onto the open PopTracker window, or move it into the /poptracker/packs folder.

This pack features auto-update, so you should be prompted to update when you open the pack.

## To Use
Open PopTracker, click the Folder Icon in the top left corner, and select the "Oracle of Seasons Tracker" then choose your preferred layout 

## Connecting to Archipelago
Click the AP button in the top left of the window. Enter your server:port (most likely archipelago.gg:PORT_NUMBER), then enter your slot name (the name in your YAML file), then the server password (empty if there isn't one). Afterward, the AP button should turn green, which means you're now auto-tracking.

## Special Thanks
